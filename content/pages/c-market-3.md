### **Element 1: What market or markets does the company operate in?**

Throughout this course, we will be looking at Spotify and building a narrative based on the company's finances.

Let's look at the market in which Spotify operates. As Spotify is a listed company, it is required by law to publish an annual report which contains a summary of its financial performance for the financial year. This should always be the first place to look when trying to understand more about a company.

You can find the full list of Spotify's financial statements [here](https://investors.spotify.com/financials/default.aspx).

We will be looking at its [2020 annual report](https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/4e770a8c-ee99-49a8-9f9e-dcc191807b56.pdf).
