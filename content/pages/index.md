Welcome to the Cash Flow Tutorial!

In this tutorial, you're going to be learning to build a DCF model by valuing a company called Spotify (if you haven't heard of it, you've likely been living under a rock--but don't worry, you can still follow along!)

This tutorial assumes no prior knowledge in finance, but will still be appropriate for those with finance training. By the end of the tutorial, you should have:

 - a fully functional DCF model for Spotify that you can download and use
 - a working knowledge of valuation and just enough knowledge of finance and accounting to get started
 - a working knowledge of the Cash Flow tool, so you can use it to automatically create your own DCF models in the future.

The tutorial is divided into the following topics and lasts about 3 hours.
