Welcome to the Cash Flow Valuation Course!

In this course, you're going to be learning to build a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model by valuing Spotify, the popular music streaming service. If you haven't heard of Spotify, you've probably been living under a rock--but don't worry, you can still follow along!

This course requires **no prior knowledge of finance**. However, any prior experience you have with finance will certainly be helpful for more quickly grasping the material. 

By the end of this course, you should have:

 - a fully functional DCF valuation model for Spotify that you can download and use
 - a conceptual framework for valuing any company, supplemented with just enough knowledge of finance and accounting concepts to get you started
 - a working knowledge of the **Cash Flow** tool, which you can continue using to automatically generate your own DCF models in the future.


The course is divided between the following topics and lasts about 3 hours.

 - Part A - Introduction
 - Part B - Valuation framework
 - Part C - Market
 - Part D - Competition
 - Part E - Business model
