Welcome to the Cash Flow Valuation Crash Course!

This course is an introduction to valuation and financial modelling using the Cash Flow tool. The main focus is on the valuation principles—in particular, the conceptual thought process behind each assumption used in a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.

We will not cover the mechanics of building a financial model in this course, as that part will be automated using the Cash Flow tool. Instead, we will focus on the more difficult and interesting question of what valuations assumptions to use—this is the part of financial modelling that even experienced analysts often get wrong.

This course requires **no prior knowledge of finance**. However, any finance experience you have will certainly be helpful for more quickly grasping the material. You should actively seek out information from external sources whenever there is something you don't understand.

The course is divided into 11 parts and lasts about 3 hours. The course material is meant to be read one section at a time and in order, as later sections build upon earlier ones.

Over this course, you're going to be valuing a real company—Spotify, the popular music streaming service. The aim of this is to crystallise the theory we discuss by immediately applying it in practice. By running through a detailed example of a real valuation, you will hopefully come away with a useful playbook for any valuations you need to conduct in the future.

By the end of this course, you should have:

-   a fully functional DCF valuation model for Spotify that you can download and use
-   a conceptual framework for valuing any company, supplemented with just enough knowledge of finance and accounting concepts to get you started
-   a working knowledge of the **Cash Flow** tool, so that you can continue to generate DCF models for your future valuations.
