### **Element 1: What market or markets does the company operate in?**

Sometimes, a company operates in more than one market. This can be along two dimensions:

1. Operating in multiple industries
2. Operating in multiple geographies

In such cases, it may make sense to think about its revenues as the sum of multiple streams of revenue from each market. Most companies that publish financial statements will provide some type of breakdown in this way, but if not, you might need to make some assumptions about the size of each part of its business.
