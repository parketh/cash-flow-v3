### **Element 1: What market or markets does the company operate in?**

Analysing companies that operate in a single market is easy, but some companies operates in more than one market. This can be along two dimensions:

1. Operating in multiple industries
2. Operating in multiple geographies

The easiest way to identify the markets in which a company operates is by looking at the composition of its revenues. Most companies that publish financial statements will provide a breakdown of their revenue streams, and this can provide valuable information on its market of operation.
