You might be wondering: 

> How can I model the cash flows of a business that is expected to operate indefinitely? Won't my Excel model need infinite columns?

A DCF model actually makes the simplifying assumption that after a certain number of years, the business will just continue to grow at the same rate every year (i.e. it reaches a 'steady state' of growth). This allows us to use a simple formula to calculate the value of the cash flows generated in steady state.

Not all businesses take the same amount of time to reach a steady state. Valuation analysts often use three to five years as a rule of thumb, but you should tailor it to the type of business. 

More on this later!
