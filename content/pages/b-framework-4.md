We now have a working understanding of how to value a company based on its cash flows.

However, before we can wrap up this section, there is one remaining question we must answer:

> How can the cash flows of a business be modelled if it is expected to operate indefinitely? Won't my DCF model extend to infinite columns?

Each financial year is represented in a DCF model as a column, yet most DCF models only run to around 5-6 columns.

How does this work? Well, it turns out that DCF models all rely on a single simplifying assumption, which says: after a certain number of years, it is assumed that the business will continue to grow at the same rate each year.

In effect, the company is assumed to reach a 'steady state' of growth which it will be able to maintain indefinitely. This allows us to apply the sum of geometric series formula (think back to your high school math classes!) to calculate the value of the cash flows generated by the company in steady state.

Not all businesses take the same amount of time to reach a steady state. Valuation analysts often use three to five years as a rule of thumb, but we should always tailor it to the type of business and the expected trajectory of their growth. More on this later!
