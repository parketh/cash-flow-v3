### **Element 3: How does the business make money?**

How does Spotify make money? Let's go back to the financial statements to understand its business a little better. It turns out, based on a closer reading of Note 6 (on page F-25 of the 2020 annual report), that Spotify has two types of customers:

1. **Premium** users, who pay a monthly fee to access Spotify's music streaming services on-demand and offline
2. **Ad-Supported** (i.e. **Free**) users, who don't pay any money but nonetheless provide Spotify with revenues through the advertisements displayed across its music and podcast content
