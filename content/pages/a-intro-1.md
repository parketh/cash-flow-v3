Valuing a business is a lot like telling a good story. There are seven elements of this particular story we will keep coming back to, and as I'm a fan of stating conclusions upfront, here they all are in order:

### **Element 1. &nbsp; What market or markets does the company operate in?** 
   
One of the first things we should do in order to better understand a company is define the market(s) in which it operates. A company like Coca Cola has a rather well-defined market, but a company like Google is far more complex - it operates in online search, advertising, cloud computing, amongst other sectors. The market(s) in which a company operates can be an important indicator of its profitability and prospects for growth.
