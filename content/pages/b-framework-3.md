> 2. The value of a company is equal to the **present value of its future cash flows**

Let's break down the bit in bold: 

### _**"Present value..."**_

Imagine you had a choice between receiving $10 today and $10 in a year's time. Which do you prefer? Most people have a time preference for cash that is received sooner rather than later. 

If you're thinking, *"hmm... I'm not sure I do"*, there's a more practical explanation for this. If you had $10 today, you could invest it in low-risk assets such as government bonds that would yield more than $10 in a year's time. Applying this same principle, cash flows that are generated by a company further out into the future need to be "discounted" to get to their value today. 

It turns out that time preference follows a logarithmic curve. Generally speaking, the greater the discount rate (a value representing the extent of our time preference) we apply, the steeper the curve and the less our future cash flows are worth in present value terms.
