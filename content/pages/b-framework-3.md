> "... the **value of a company is equal to the present value of its future cash flows.**"

Let's now look at the part in front:

### _**"...present value..."**_

What does present value mean?

Imagine you had a choice between receiving $10 today and $10 in a year's time. Which do you prefer? It turns out that, because of the way we perceive time, most people prefer cash that is received sooner rather than later.

Besides perception, there is a more practical explanation for why a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. If you had $10 today, you could invest it in financial assets that would yield you more than $10 in a year's time. For example, if the asset returned 5% a year, my $10 today would be worth $10.5 next year.

Applying this same principle, cash flows that are generated by a company further out into the future need to be "discounted" to derive an equivalent value in today's terms. This discounting ensures we are comparing apples to oranges when looking at a company's cash flows.

As it turns out, time preference follows a logarithmic curve, as shown in the diagram below. Generally speaking, the greater the discount rate (a value representing the extent of an investor's time preference) we apply, the steeper the curve and the less our future cash flows are worth in present value terms.
