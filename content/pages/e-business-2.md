### **Element 3: How does the business make money?**

To understand how a business makes money, we need to understand three things:

1. ~~what market does the company serve~~ **(we've already answered this in Part 1!)**
2. what value does the company create for its customers in each of these markets
3. what share of this value creation is it able to capture in the form of cash revenues.
