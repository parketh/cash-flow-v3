### **Element 3: How does the business make money?**

Although Spotify has more **Ad-Supported** Users than **Premium** users (see page 47), the majority of Spotify's revenues are generated from its **Premium** users. The difference at the gross profit level is even more stark. (Note that gross profits are revenues less the direct costs associated with providing music streaming services—don't worry if this is unclear, we'll come back to this later.)

To summarise, Spotify generates: 

- significant value for its **Ad-Supported** users—they get to use the service for free! (Albeit with a more limited set of functionality.) Yet, Spotify captures a relatively low proportion of this value creation.
- more value for **Premium** users than its **Ad-Supported** users, as these users have the added functionality of streaming music on-demand and downloading music for offline use. However, Spotify captures a much larger part of the value it creates for this group of users.
