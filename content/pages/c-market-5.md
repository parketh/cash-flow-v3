Let's go back to Spotify's financial statements. To locate the bit on Spotify's market segments, we can:

1. **Locate the financial statements**
   a. Let's start by checking the Table of Contents on page i. It appears as though the financial statements are on page 96.
   b. Let's go to page 96. The bit at the top of the page says that the financial statements are at page F-1...okay, let's follow the trail.
   c. Page F-1 shows an index of the different parts of the financial statements. The one we want is the statement of comprehensive (loss)/income, located on page F-5. In other countries, this might simply be called an income statement.
2. **Find the line that says 'Revenue', and look for the corresponding note**
   a. 'Revenue' is the first line in the income statement. It has an annotation linking to Note 4. Let's check out Note 4. If we go back to the index on page 96, we can see that the notes to the financial statements start at page F-10. Keep scrolling down until we get to Note 4 on page F-22.
   b. Note 4 says, "_The Group discloses revenue by reportable segment and geographic area in Note 6_". Let's follow the trail again...
   c. Finally, we get to what we are looking for at Note 6, on page F-25.

Finding this one item was super complicated, but that's a pretty common search process for digging out information in financial statements.

You'll get better as you do this more and familiarise yourself with the layout of the annual report. You might even discover your own shortcuts!
