> 2. The value of a company is equal to the **present value of its future cash flows**

Let's break down the bit in bold: 

### _**"...future cash flows"**_

Future cash flows are the difference between the cash revenues and cash costs generated by a company in the future.

Let's imagine Billy and Naomi are starting a lemonade stand business. Their business will bring in cash from lemonade sales, but they will also have to pay for the material costs of lemons, sugar and water, plus any other operating costs such as renting a stand.

We only care about *future* cash flows because cash generated in the past may have already been reinvested in the business (e.g. used to buy even more lemonade stands) or taken out of the business by its owners (e.g. used to buy a new toy).
