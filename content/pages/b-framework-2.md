Let's break this down so we understand exactly what it means:

> "... the **value of a company is equal to the present value of its future cash flows.**"

Starting with the last part:

### _**"...future cash flows"**_

Future cash flows are the difference between the cash revenues and cash costs generated by a company in the future. This is illustrated in the diagram below. Companies that generate more cash revenues will have higher cash flows, while companies that incur more cash costs will have lower cash flows.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Imagine Billy and Naomi are thinking of starting a lemonade business. Their business will bring in cash revenues from lemonade sales, but they will also have to pay for the material costs of lemonade, plus other operating costs such as the rental costs of a lemonade stand. The future cash flows from their business can be estimated by deducting the material and operating costs from expected cash revenues.

Why are we only interested in cash flows generated in the future? Well, cash flows generated in the past may have already been reinvested in the business (for example, used by Naomi to buy even more ingredients to make lemonade) or taken out of the business by its owners (for example, used by Billy to buy a new toy).

Therefore, the value of a company today should be based only on its ability to generate cash flows in the future.
