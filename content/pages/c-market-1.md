### **Element 1: What market or markets does the company operate in?**

Understanding the market a company operates in is important because quite often, that helps to paint 70% of the picture. McKinsey, an authority on valuation, disaggregates revenue growth into three components: 

 1. portfolio momentum
 2. M&A
 3. market share performance.

In a survey they conducted, **portfolio momentum**—meaning the growth enjoyed by a company because the markets they are a part of are growing—explained **66%** of overall company growth!

In other words:

1. A company operating in a growing market will most likely also grow (i.e. a rising tide lifts all boats)
2. A company in a shrinking market may be able to grow by increasing their share of that market, but that would be like trying to swim upstream—it gets increasingly difficult.
