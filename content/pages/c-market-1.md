### **Element 1: What market or markets does the company operate in?**

Understanding the market a company operates in is extremely important. McKinsey, an authority on valuation, conducted a study in which it disaggregated revenue growth of thousands of surveyed companies into three components:

1.  portfolio momentum
2.  M&A
3.  market share performance.

Of these, it found that **portfolio momentum**—meaning the growth that a company experiences as a direct result of the market(s) that it is a part of—explained **66%** of overall company growth!

In other words:

1. A company operating in a growing market will most likely also grow (i.e. a rising tide lifts all boats)
2. A company in a shrinking market may be able to grow by increasing their share of that market, but maintaining that growth would get increasingly difficult—it would be like trying to swim upstream.
