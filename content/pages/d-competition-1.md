### **Element 2: Who are the key competitors?**

Peter Thiel, founder of Paypal and billionaire venture capitalist, said in his best-selling book Zero to One:

> "If you want to create and capture lasting value, look to build a monopoly". 
 
Some monopolies are anticompetitive of course, and therefore undesirable for consumers, but the point is that competition reduces the share of the market a company can capture, as well as the price it is able to charge for the goods or services it creates. 

We can combine this idea with our market hypothesis to make the following generalisation:

1. A company operating in a growing market with no competition will likely grow very quickly (assuming no new players are able to enter the market)
2. A company operating in a growing but competitive market will nonetheless grow (a rising tide raises all boats)
3. A company in a shrinking market will likely find it difficult to grow, irrespective of the amount of competition it faces (recall the swimming upstream analogy).
