### **Element 3: How does the business make money?**

> 3. what share of this value creation is it able to capture in the form of cash revenues.

A term like *"value creation"* can seem really abstract, so let's put it in more concrete terms. 

The value a company creates for its customers is equal to **the benefit customers gain from using its product, relative to the next best alternative.** 

For example, a company that sells bottled water in the supermarket probably doesn't create much value for its customers: there are so many available alternatives that provide a similar product. Whereas, a company that sells bottled water in the dessert probably does provide a lot of value for the parched travellers that travel through it.
