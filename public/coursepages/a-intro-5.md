### **Element 4. &nbsp; What are the company's costs, and how are they structured?**

The cash that a company generates is not just what they bring in, but what they have left over after paying the costs of running a business. The structure of a business's fixed and variable costs can have important implications for the variability of its financial performance (i.e. its risk), and therefore how it finances its business.

Companies that have lower costs relative to their revenues are more valuable than companies with higher costs. One way to assess the amount of cash that a company is able to retain is by looking at profit margins. Profit margins are often also the best starting point for forecasting cash costs.
